# EuroSAT Land Classification

Welcome to the **EuroSAT Land Classification** project! This repository contains a Gradio-powered interface for classifying satellite images into one of ten land-use categories. The project leverages deep learning and the EuroSAT dataset to aid in environmental monitoring, urban planning, and agricultural management.

---

## Introduction

This project aims to accurately classify satellite land-use images into 10 categories, including:

- **AnnualCrop**
- **Forest**
- **HerbaceousVegetation**
- **Highway**
- **Industrial**
- **Pasture**
- **PermanentCrop**
- **Residential**
- **River**
- **SeaLake**

Using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the EuroSAT dataset, the interface predicts the most likely land-use category for a given satellite image.

## Dataset

The EuroSAT dataset consists of labeled satellite images representing 10 distinct land-use types. You can access the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/apollo2506/eurosat-dataset/data).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/eurosat-classification.git](https://github.com/MAS4AI/mini-project-ironHack-CNN)
   cd eurosat-classification
2. Install dependencies:

   To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install gradio tensorflow pillow numpy

3.	Download and organize the dataset:
    Ensure that the dataset is downloaded and organized as per the structure defined in the example_images dictionary in the code.


## Usage
